## 001 - Résumé

In perusing the "Explore" section of GitHub, I found a repo created by [mrzool](https://github.com/mrzool/cv-boilerplate) for a CV created using LaTeX. Needing to spruce up my résumé and finding the look of it visually pleasing, I decided to kill two birds by updating my résumé and learn a little about LaTeX. Like many things, LaTeX is pretty straight-forward until it's not. I had some challenges. Thankfully, there have been many before me and I was able to put it together, see link on my [home](aouriri.github.io) page. I can definitely see how flexible and orderly it would be to craft documents with LaTeX and hope to do just that...once I really figure out how things work.


## 002 - Information Organization Project (IOP)

*Word of Caution:* Along with my example, you, dear reader, can find quite a few examples from other students from this class by employing a simple search. While these examples are helpful in gaining some idea in crafting the IOP, if you are currently in this class (INFO 5200), do **NOT** copy and paste, paraphrase, or take any action where your project would mirror an example you've seen. Assuming that much hasn't changed since I was enrolled in this class, it would be better to ask questions during the chats and review the recorded lectures for insight.

If you would like to take a look at my last draft submitted, click [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/UririIOP.pdf).


## 003 - Portal to Texas History Metadata

For a metadata class (INFO 5210), we were tasked with inputting metadata for patents ingested into the UNT [Portal to Texas History](https://texashistory.unt.edu/) database. Below, are the entries for which I specifically entered metadata.
