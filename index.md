**sem·i·pro·fes·sion·al**
/ˌsemēprəˈfeSHənl/

Having some features of professional work but requiring less knowledge, skill, and judgment. Traditional examples of semiprofessions include social work, journalism, **librarianship**, teaching and nursing.

`whoami`: I currently work as a staff member in what would be considered the "technical services" department of an academic library - troubleshooting issues with our electronic resources being one of my responsibilites. In addition to this, I also assist with our growing data services by helping our community create data management plans to go along with the research. Academically, I'm currently working on my Master of Science in Library Science (MLS) in the hopes of becoming a librarian - particularly, a librarian who works with emerging technology, data science and visualization, and data curation. I'm also partial to DIY technology.

Outside of the all of this stuff, I enjoy Netflix and Hulu, especially, their original programming. I enjoy cooking and eating (mostly eating) food of all kinds. TexMex is my fave. I like learning things - big things, small things, esoteric things - whether I can turn that into a profitable skill or a neat party trick. I *love* a good book and have the bedside stacks to prove it and, of course naïvely, this is why I wanted to become a librarian. Not much else to me. **Welcome.** :wave:
