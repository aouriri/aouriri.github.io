**sem·i·pro·fes·sion·al**
/ˌsemēprəˈfeSHənl/ <sup>[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiprofession#cite_ref-1)</sup>

Having some features of professional work but requiring less knowledge, skill, and judgment. Traditional examples of semiprofessions include social work, journalism, **librarianship**, teaching and nursing.

`whoami`: I currently work as a staff member in what would be considered the "technical services" department of an academic library - troubleshooting issues with our electronic resources being one of my responsibilites. In addition to this, I also assist with our growing data services department. Academically, I've recently received my Master of Science in Library Science (MLS) in the hopes of becoming a librarian - particularly, a librarian who works with emerging technologies, data science and visualization, semantic web/linked data and data curation. I'm also partial to DIY technology.

Outside of the all of this stuff, I enjoy Netflix and Hulu, especially their original programming. I enjoy cooking and eating (mostly eating) food of all kinds. TexMex is my fave. I like learning things - big things, small things, esoteric things - whether I can turn that into a profitable skill or a neat party trick. I *love* a good book and have the bedside stacks to prove it and, of course naïvely, this is why I wanted to become a librarian. Not much else to me. **Welcome.** :wave:
